# Oscilloscope
Schematic, PCB, simulation results, firmware and outputs for 20MHz oscilloscope.

#### Front End Desgin
Specification was for an anti-aliasing filter suitable for the 40MSPS maximum sample rate. 
To be implemented with a minimum of a first-order 20dB per decade response and Â±2dB maximum ripple in the pass band.

The plot below shows these specifications were satisfied. A flat response (-13.8 to -13.7dB) can be seen in the pass band, giving a ripple of less than 2dB. 
The 3dB cut-off point is at 20Mhz (-16.5dB) allowing for a maximum sampling rate of 40MSPS. The response can be seen to drop off by 20dB per decade.
