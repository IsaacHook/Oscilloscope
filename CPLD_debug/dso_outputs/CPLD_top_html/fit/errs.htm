<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld - Unable to retrieve the path to the iSE Project Repository. Will   use the default filename of 'CPLD_top.ise'.INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'ENABLE' based upon the LOC   constraint 'P1'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly in   your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be   ignored.INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'FAST_CLK' based upon the LOC   constraint 'P44'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly   in your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be   ignored.INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'SLOW_CLK' based upon the LOC   constraint 'P43'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly   in your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be   ignored.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld:1007 - Removing unused input(s) 'SLOW_CLK'.  The input(s) are   unused after optimization. Please verify functionality via simulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld:1239 - The global clock designation (BUFG) on signal   'FAST_CLK_IBUF' is ignored. Most likely the signal is gated and therefore   cannot be used as a global control signal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld:1239 - The global clock designation (BUFG) on signal 'ENABLE_IBUF'   is ignored. Most likely the signal is gated and therefore cannot be used as a   global control signal.</td></tr>
